Being an open source application (based on FBReader), it uses other 3rd party applications.
To protect further from any unknown issues/mistakes, we have already cut all permissions.
This way, the application:
- does not use (nor request) any network connection
- does not use (nor request) sdcard access (neither write nor read) (we have limited to sand-boxed directory for storing the books).
